# midiMozart
A music composer that uses either genetic algorithms (with myself serving as the non-automated subjective fitness function), or my own fine-tuned heuristics and rules of thumb.

Progress ======

Around 6.5k tabs have been scraped, and then converted into .midi files (from .gp5 and .gpx). Next, we must transform the .midi files into a more ML-digestable format, and prep them to be feauturized. After that will come the drafts of the genetic algorithms. Stay tuned.
